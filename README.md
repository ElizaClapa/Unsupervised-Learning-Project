## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we perform a comprehensive unsupervised learning analysis on the "Wholesale Data" dataset, which contains information about various products sold by a grocery store, along with details about distribution channels and regions.

### 🛠️ Part I: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis & Pre-processing

1. **Data Import:** The dataset is imported into Python for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is checked for missing or incorrect data and cleaned accordingly.

### 📄 Description of the Wholesale Data

- **Channel:** Refers to the distribution channel (Horeca or Retail).
- **Region:** Refers to the region (Lisbon, Oporto, or Other).
- **Fresh:** Represents the annual spending on fresh products.
- **Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, Delicassen:** Represent the annual spending on these categories.

### 🔍 Key Insights from Analysis

1. **PCA and Elbow Plot:**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data.
   - The Elbow Plot shows the optimal number of components to retain.

2. **KMeans Clustering:**
   - KMeans clustering was used to identify patterns based on spending across product categories.

### 🎯 Conclusion

The unsupervised learning techniques applied in this project identified meaningful patterns and clusters within the dataset. The analysis highlighted the significant influence of regional factors on customer purchasing behavior and revealed clear segmentation of customers based on their spending on specific product categories.
